WatchWithMe is an application dedicated to letting you watch something with your friends as quickly and as easily as possible.

Anyone can host a room, chat, and watch content synchronously without an account.

Features Include:
- Text Chat
- Video Playback Synchronization

Planned Features:
- Voice Chat
- Persistent Accounts
- Invite-only rooms


Requirements:
- An available instance of Redis
- Python 2.7
- pip (for dependencies)

Installation:
- check out the project via `git clone https://github.com/alex-laties/watchwithme.git`
- install dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- set up `config.py`. `config.py.sample` can be copied and used verbatim if lazy.

To Run:
- Currently, there's no provided configs for running this project under a nice wsgi server like gunicorn or uwsgi, although setting it up would be trivial. For now, running `python server.py` should suffice.
